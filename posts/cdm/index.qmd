## The Data Administrator (DA)

```ojs
user("Doc", "bugs-bunny.png")
```

We‚Äòve seen projects with no DA or where DA don‚Äôt spend necessary time. In these projects parties add their data sylo to a shared database. Usually, not a surprise, it ends up blaming each other on writing incorrect data or even worse - silently pushing more silo with a honking sound.

The concept of Data Administrator described in [@date2003] - it is a person responsible for data consistency. In clinical trial she will call up for a board.

As any other project data management one must have a person with complete vision [@brooks1975]

üôè In any clinical trial this vision is scribed in clinical trial protocol. You need one, at least very primitive, but please - get one. Just dump your thoughts and better try to structure it according to this and you will be blessed.
